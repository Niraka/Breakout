Breakout
========

A JavaScript version of the well known "Breakout" game. Developed as a university project.

The game includes the standard features from most versions of the Breakout game with a few modifications to allow the player to customise their playthrough.

The project achieved a mark of 94/100, with only a few marks lost for issues with the accuracy of collision detection & resolution (and commenting surrounding it).

Projected developed: 13/05/2014
